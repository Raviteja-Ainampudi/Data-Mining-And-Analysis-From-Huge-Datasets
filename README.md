#Data Mining and Analysis From Huge Datasets

- The large datasets are index traces of HTTP GET responses of NASA simulators are used for this data mining and analysis. (Each text file >200 MB.)
- The useful data is extracted in the JSON format and saved into new text files for corresponding requirements.
- Graphical illustration is done in Pie charts and Bar graphs using the Pylab library.
- Various parameters of HTTP responses were mined, analyzed, compared and portrayed graphically.
- Coding done in Python.


====
Outcomes
====

- The average frequency of HTTP traffic requested this simulator traffic.
- Distinct visitors who requested this simulators data.
- Total number of distinct visitors requetesd traffic for each day in the corresponding month.
- Top 15 visitors for this simulators data all time and their share in the whole HTTP traffic.
- Distinct domains (.edu, .com and .net) which requsted HTTP data and their share in the whole traffic.
- Distinct HTTP responses 200, 304 and 302. And their share in the whole responses sent out by this simulator.
- The corresponding analysis for these graphs were depicted graphically.


#Pro-Tips

- Extract the tar data for input feed.
- Analysis can also be done on each vistor requesting for traffic also.
- These are output text files where the output is extracted using the JSON format. (Average_Size.txt,ComVsEduVsNet_Domain.txt,  Distinct_Clients.txt, Top10_Visited.txt, Total_Access_Number_Of_Each_Day.txt)
- Further more analysis can be done and plots can be derived.
